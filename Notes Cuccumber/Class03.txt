Class 3
Recap:
We're using .feature file to write our scenarios using gherkin language
Keywords in gherkin language we use: given, when, and, then, scenario, feature
In the feature file we declare the steps and then we need to define them. We simply execute the feature file and after
that we provide definition of the steps in java folder
All the feature files we keep in a directory (features in our resources directory) in our framework
Every single scenario is a test case


Constants - in this class we provide the standart organized structure, that we don't have to change
we simply provide unique paths
CommonMethods - polymorphism in java and we'll use it
CommonMethods class in our framework is used to write all the methods we will be using in the majority of scenarios
(Code reusabillity)

Use of polymorphism in our project --> click method in our CommonMethods class
        --> we are overloading it when passing different WebElements

duplication of step definition will not work
