Class 5
Recap
Creating multiple steps classes for multiple feature files
POM - page object model design pattern

In Common Methods we're calling page initializers method. This method is going to call the objects of page classes
which will call the constructor and these constructors will initialize all the web elements

pages contain:
PageInitializer class --> here we'll create all objects of the classes

runners contain:
Runner class - will allow us to run all of our scripts in one time. In our framework we're creating Runners package in java

Single point execution

Smoke test - take some test cases to see if the to check for the functionality 15-20 test cases
regression - we use it when new

Difference between bug an issue is:
when the devs are working in the development environment it is called issue, because it is still under development
but if the same thing is sent to Qa/test environment and then the issue occurs, this is called bug in the applications

2 things you'll execute in practice
smoke scenario --> if it has the key functionality of the application
regression scenario --> by default all scenarios belong to regression
So make @smoke @regression tags in the feature file for each scenario
Also create Regression and Smoke classes under the runners package to be more organized

We have to utilize the code reusability as much as we can!!!

Background functionality - the scenario flow has to be the same; the part that have common part.
If the flow of the test case changed, even if we have 100 common parts,
we cannot take it tho the background is a part that will execute before every scenario
ONE Background feature for ONE feature file
